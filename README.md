Hello Earthlings !! 😁

This is a 💰 coin collecting pc game called Numismatist And The Wrath Of Corona . I made this using JAVASCRIPT PHASER framework. I have also added highscore feature that uses local storage to store highscore. To make the game more intresting I have added an exciting feature of increasing speed after collecting all coins and also increasing corona count by one 😝 . It can be played by just using up, down, left and right arrow keys.

If you want to play it then visit this link 👉 https://tyagititans.github.io/Numismatist-And-The-Wrath-of-Corona.github.io/

You can also download the files and place them in one folder and launch the index.html to play. Hope you enjoy it 😊 and crack the highscores by competing with your friends 😁.
